      <p class="card-text">I'm an engineering student, pursuing my B.E.Mechanical at Loyola-ICAM College of Engineering and Technology <br>
        I'm very enthusiastic about Engineering in the first place. I love to explore new things in and around me. I experiment what I explore, because what is the use in exploring and not experimenting it. I'm driven more towards the side of designing. I see myself as a design and developing engineer. <br>
        I'm very passionate about organizing events. I love to plan and keep ahead of things. I have good experience in organizing events even in an intense moment. Keeping things in control is one of my ability that I take pride off. Thats one key I believe in leading a group and planning events. <br>
        I always think I'm a leader, I believe that everyone is a leader in themselves. I take responsibilities and make sure I grow in such a way I help others grow with me. Come on thats a leader there!! <br>
        Keeping things intact also means, management and solving a problem. I've faced a lot of intense moments where i handled the situations well enough to manage and solve.      </p>
